			<center><p>India’s apparel market will be worth $59.3 billion in 2022, making it the sixth largest in the world, comparable to the United Kingdom’s ($65 billion) and Germany’s ($63.1 billion), according to data from McKinsey’s FashionScope. The aggregate income of the addressable population (individuals with more than $9,500 in annual income) is expected to triple between now and 2025. The supply side of the industry is equally robust, and the growth of textile and apparel exports is expected to accelerate. According to a 2017 McKinsey survey, 41 percent of chief procurement officers expect to increase the share of their sourcing from India, where average labor costs are significantly lower than China’s and comparable to Vietnam’s. Raw materials (such as cotton, wool, silk, and jute) are highly available, which enables participation in the entire fashion value chain.

			<center><p>1.1 The textile industry is the second largest employer in the country and plays a pivotal role in the economic growth and development of the country. The industry contributes to 14% of the total manufacturing output contributing to 10.5% of export earnings and employs 35 million workers. The size of the Indian apparel market is estimated to be $45 billion and it is expected to grow up to $200 billion by 2025
				<br><br>

1.2 Considering the potential of apparel sector to contribute to jobs and export earnings, the Government of India have been taking necessary measures to strengthen the apparel industry. For every Rs 1 lakh invested in the industry, an average of 7 additional jobs is created. Therefore, there is a need to promote the apparel manufacturing sector for creation of employment, increasing export earnings and provide fillip to the national economy
<br><br>

1.3 However, several constraints are faced by first generation entrepreneurs and start-ups in the apparel sector viz., lack of capital for investment in land, buildings and plant and machinery, limited access to finance, competition within the existing market and operational inefficiencies due to lack of trained manpower and poor market linkages.
<br><br>

1.4 In view of the above, there is need for creation of a holistic ecosystem that would boost

entrepreneurship in the sector by systematically addressing the issues of lack of

infrastructure and ecosystem linkages.

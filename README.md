Women around the world faces lack of access to knowledge and capital for starting a business, crowdfunding, campaigning, and more. Women are limited by several factors at different times in their careers, including disadvantaged economic status, discrimination and restrictive gender norms, and lack of access to knowledge on how to start a business or traditional fundraising networks. Recognizing the profound gender gap, women need alternative resources and tools to help level the playing field. This is a web-based platform for women so that they can overcome the economic and social barriers that prevent their access to right decision-making through training, mentoring and technology.
